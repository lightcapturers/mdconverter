**Models Covered in This Guide**

**2010-2016 Audi S4 (B8/8.5)**

**2008-2016 Audi S5 (B8/8.5)**

The B8 generation Audi S4 & S5 offers refined performance for spirited street driving right out of the box. However, with the right modifications, these cars can be quite competent out on the track. Equipped with a potent and powerful supercharged 3.0 liter V6, paired with Audi's legendary Quattro AWD system, the B8 S4 & S5 are a popular choice for enthusiasts that drive year-round, even in inclement weather conditions.

**Important note regarding wheel hardware:** All of the wheel designs listed in this guide, **aside from the Flow Formed VS-5**, are engineered to use 60 degree conical style hardware, you will need to replace the factory Audi R13 ball seat lug bolts with aftermarket conical style lug bolts or nuts. We offer a full Audi stud conversion kit complete with 19mm conical style lug nuts to support these wheels, which you can find on our website here: [APEX 75mm M14x1.5mm Stud Conversion Kit W/ 19mm Conical Seat Nuts](https://apexwheels.com/accessories/wheel-stud-kits/apex-75mm-m14x1-5-audi-mercedes-5-lug-hex-head-stud-kit)

Audi S5 B8


**These fitments are the perfect match for weekend track warriors and hardcore racers seeking to maximize the wheel and tire size that they can fit on their Audi B8 S4/S5.** These aggressive wheel specs will occasionally require supportive modifications commonly found on track cars, such as increased negative camber. While certain configurations can provide a complete direct fit on a stock car, additional modifications may be required for a rub-free fitment depending on your suspension setup and specific tire selection. With a focus on brake clearance, our 18" and 19" fitments are able to clear the factory S4/S5 brakes with ease, as well as a variety of aftermarket BBKs.

**Front & Rear: 18x9" ET25 With 255/40-18 tires**

- Available in VS-5RS design only.
- Direct fit with street-focused tire compounds.
- **Conical style lug bolts or lug nuts required.**

- More aggressive 200TW or R compound tires may require a touch of additional front negative camber to alleviate any poke or potential rubbing under suspension compression.

- **Conical style lug bolts or lug nuts required.**

**Front & Rear: 19x10" ET38 With 275/35-19 tires**

- Available in VS-5RS, ML-10RT, and SM-10 designs.

- More aggressive 200TW or R compound tires may also require a touch of additional front negative camber to alleviate any poke or potential rubbing under suspension compression.
- 255/35-19 tires can also be used for an easier fit.

## Additional Resources

Whether you are a casual weekend track warrior that still enjoys your car on the street, or a hard core racer competing for a spot on the podium, negative camber is a vital part of chassis setup that has many benefits. Not only will adding negative camber create more room for wider wheel and tire configurations, it more importantly improves handling, turn-in and tire longevity. Learn more in our blog article, [The Positives of Negative Camber](https://apexwheels.com/blog/technical-discussion/the-positives-of-negative-camber).
