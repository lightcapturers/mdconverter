###### Description

COBB High Flow Filters are designed to permit very high flow rates, minimize restriction, maximize filtration and provide a long life filter. It uses a proprietary single layer polyester construction with a precision molded rubber base.

How do I service my COBB High Flow Filter?

- 1\. Remove the air filter from the air box.
- 2\. Remove any larger debris, such as leaves by hand.
- 3\. Submerse the filter in warm soapy water and gently massage the filter material.
- 4\. Rinse the filter material with clean water.
- 5\. Leave the filter to dry naturally in the open air

**Note:** Do not use compressed air or direct heat to speed up the drying process as it can damage the filter material.

* * *

###### Why?

The COBB High Flow Filter ensures that only clean air passes into your engine for maximum efficiency. Why not treat your car to fresh air with a COBB High Flow Filter and let it reward you with increased power and fuel economy!
